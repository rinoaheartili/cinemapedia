# cinemapedia

A new Flutter project.

## Specific Topics in the Section
This section will lay the groundwork for everything we'll begin building here and in a couple of additional sections.

The idea is to start creating reusable, structured, and expandable code from the start, making it easier to add new features in the future.

Specifically, we'll cover:

 - Datasources
    - Implementations
    - Abstractions
 - Repositories
    - Implementations
    - Abstractions
 - Models
 - Entities
 - Riverpod
    - Provider
    - StateNotifierProvider
    - Notifiers
 - Mappers

The entire goal of this section is to establish the orderly foundations of our architecture so we can strengthen them and see them in practice.

Additionally

This section aims to perform 4 queries on TheMovieDB to obtain:

 - Popular movies
 - Movies in theaters
 - Top-rated movies
 - Movies coming soon

To achieve this, we'll continue working with the same principles and gradually build a robust application.

We'll also learn a little about infinite horizontal scrolling, slivers, and more.

## Dev
 1. Copiar el .env.template y renombrarlo a .env
 2. Cambiar las variables de entorno (The MovieDB)
